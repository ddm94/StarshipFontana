# Starship Fontana #

This is a small C++ game using the SDL library.

## Installation ##

You will have to have the SDL development libraries installed on
your system.  The easiest way to compile is to use a command-line

$ g++ -c -std=c++11 src/*.cpp
$ g++ -o starship *.o -lSDL2 -lSDL2_image

Running these two commands will produce an executable file called "starship" in the
top-level directory.  To execute this file do the following

`$ ./starship`
 
from the top-level directory.  The game will expect to find the
`assets` directory under its current working directory.

## Credits ##
